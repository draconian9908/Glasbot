# Architectual Review #2 Preparation Document

### Background and Context

1. RPG game foundation with planting robot fighting enemies
2. The formating of the game - window and terrain differences
    - The window is following the player around the terrain - only showing a certain piece
    - The terrain is the whole map and background that the character is walking around
3. The player is a sprite as well as the bags displayed on the map 
    - The player is on the window, while the bags are on the terrain
    
### Questions

1. The terrain and window difference are causing us to be unable to make collisions occur 
    - Any ideas how to manage this with the enemies? 
        - They need to somehow fight the enemies and make the enemies bounce off
        - Once the enemies are damaged enough they should disappear
    - How to make sprites disappear without the collisions?
2. Tips on the visuals
    - Should inventory be larger?
    - Should bags containing different things be different colors?
    - Placement and size of the score and health parts?
    - Anything else?
 
### Agenda

1. Give background
    - Really explain the window and terrain pieces
2. Ask the questions
    - Focus on the collision issue - most important is the idea with enemies
3. Feedback form

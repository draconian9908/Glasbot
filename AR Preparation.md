#### Software Architecture Overview:

* Creating class for tiles which will allow easy changes between land features
* Create class for main character 
* Class for the camera - scroll around the world as you move
* Class for the monsters - maybe inheret from the character or both from the same base class
* Create a map editor to edit the terrian easily on the backend

### 2. Key questions
